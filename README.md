# BlackFriday

## Overview

BlackFriday is a data analysis project focused on exploring and gaining insights from the Black Friday sales dataset. The main objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize purchasing patterns, and uncover trends within the dataset using Jupyter Notebook.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of key insights
- Identification of customer purchase behaviors and trends
